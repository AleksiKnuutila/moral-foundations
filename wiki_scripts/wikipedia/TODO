1. read the conservapedia pages
2. read all the wikipedia titles
2. look for the title in wikipedia titles;
		if it doesn't exist, look if a C page has an alternative title (as a Redirection)
			if yes, save it but in a different list
			if not, skip
		if it does, check whether the page is a disambiguation page or a redirection
